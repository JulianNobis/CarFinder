## Introduction
This text introduces the implementation of a system which supports
people at finding the car that suits them best, like www.wahlkabine.at
helps people find the political party that fits their political standpoints
best.
The basic idea is to provide a service, where users are asked some
questions concerning their interests and the system suggests cars that
match the personality profile.
It is planned to implement this project in a step by step approach, where
the first steps already result in a usable product. Further improvements,
which mainly go into more sophisticated questions and better selection
algorithms, can follow.
The product proposed here differs from already existing products,
because all products that are currently available only address the UK
and US market. In the first step our primary focus lies on the Austrian
market, and in further stages we could expand to other and maybe even
the global market.
